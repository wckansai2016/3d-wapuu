# 3D Wapuu
So I made a 3D version of Wapuu and released the 3D Data On GitHub.
Anyone can download that data.
And that also able to edit shape and reuse.

That was include the data for 3D CG Animation and 3D Printer.

If you have 3D CG Software or CAD Software, you can use that in CG Animaion and CAD.
And If you have the 3D Printer, you can print out the same Wapuu object.

We can expect make variation of 3D wapuu contents by use this.
